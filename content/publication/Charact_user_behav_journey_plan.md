abstract = "Journey planners support users in the organization of their trips, by presenting them results with multimodal solutions. While the benefits for the users are straightforward, other stakeholders (such as transport operators and planners) might benefit from understanding how users behave. In this paper, we analyze and characterize user behavior in journey planners, with the aim of getting insights from different perspectives (namely, trip search and both sorting and selection actions related to trip options). Our results show that, in order to characterize user behavior, multiple perspectives have to be taken into account, and that users speaking different languages behave differently."
