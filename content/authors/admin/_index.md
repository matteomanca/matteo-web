I am a data scientist, with background in Computer Science, and several years of experience working on data-driven solutions in cross-functional
teams. I have experience collecting, analysing, mining large datasets and implementing machine learning models.
I thrive on challenges and I like to use data to support decision making and to solve real world problems.
I taught data science related courses in different masters and I am program committee member in some of the main Data Mining conferences.
I obtained my PhD in computer science from the University of Cagliari (IT), with a thesis on the study and implementation of recommendation
approaches for the social media domain.
